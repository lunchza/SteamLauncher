SteamLauncher
=============
Wrapper client for Steam that fixes launch issues amongst other things.

Brief overview
==============
SteamLauncher is a program born out of frustration with Steam. After having to delete ClientRegistry.blob every time I restart my pc I decided to write a program that does it for me.

How to use
==========
Place a shortcut to the jar in Startup under Start menu->All programs or alternatively just change your Steam shortcut to point to SteamLauncher instead.

Requirements
============
Windoze
Java 1.6 or newer
[Temporary]Steam installed in the default location. Alternatively the path can be edited inside config.properties in the jar itself.

Changelog
=========
v0.1a - SteamLauncher deletes ClientRegistry.blob before launching Steam
